# 📊 NHO Elektro Financial Reporting Frontend

This is a **frontend-only** implementation designed to demonstrate the UI/UX of a financial reporting system. The app simulates real-world financial reporting features using local state and mock data.

> ⚠️ Note: This project does not include a backend. All data is stored in memory and resets upon refresh (except for login credentials which persist via localStorage).
